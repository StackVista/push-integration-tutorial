# StackState push integration tutorial

This repository contains a sample project that sets up an agent check called `example` that sends topology into StackState. It uses docker to run the StackState agent to execute the check.

See the [complete tutorial](https://docs.stackstate.com/develop/tutorials/push_integration_tutorial) in the StackState documentation for more information.
